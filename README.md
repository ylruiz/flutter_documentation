## What is Flutter?

**Flutter** is a free and an open source Google's UI toolkit that allows us to build applications for different plataforms, such as mobile, web, and desktop. The best part is that we can do that by using a single codebase.  

Flutter apps are written in the [**Dart**](Dart.md) language and make use of many of the language's more advanced features.
